# Treehouse WebDev Project 5
## Word Guessing Game

In this project, you'll create a browser version of "Wheel of Success," a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

Using JavaScript, you'll create an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.

Each time the player guesses a letter, you'll need to compare the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, you'll update the game board with the selected letters.

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter they chose isn't in the phrase, you'll remove one of the player's five guesses.

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen will display.

A player can guess a letter only once. After they've guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter.
